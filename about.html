	<h2>Work Life </h2>	
		<p>I have had a life-long passion for understanding the human learning experience; I want to understand how people receive new information, how they process this information, and how people then react to this information. My interest for cognitive science from all angles -- philosophy, linguistics, psychology, anthropology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience-- has driven both my studies and my work experience. With an academic background in psychology and neurocognition research, years of experience teaching numeracy, and a passion for computer programming, the intersection of my passion lies in the new innovations that transform the human learning experience. 
		<br><br>During my last year at college, reading works by Piaget pivoted my cognitive science interest slightly to an interest in child development and the learning of a child both behaviorally and academically over time. Upon graduating, I accepted a position with Teach for America in Chicago not only because I strongly believe in creating equitable educational opportunities, but also better comprehend the learning process of children and how the American education system addresses this process. In Chicago, I earned my Masters of Arts in Teaching through Dominican University and had an opportunity to work with leaders in the community on non-biological issues affecting students emotionally and academically. After this experience, I took a position teaching Math, Science, and Computer Science at Brooke Charter Schools in Boston. Similar to TFA’s mission Brooke Charter School was a social justice driven school seeking to give opportunities to underrepresented communities. It was during my first week of teaching computer science that I suddenly grasped the importance of learning how to program and the way of thinking that learning to code teaches. 
		<br><br>I became enthusiastic about about encouraging my students, especially minority students who are underrepresented in places like Silicon Valley, to utilize and love programming as much as I began to. I wanted to show them that programming was a new way of thinking about problem solving and that it was a tool that was powerful beyond measure. I lead Robotics after school and soon after launched the first Girls Who Code at my school where I helped to encourage young girls to want to pursue computer science. The sudden light bulb that went off for me -- the realization that the future of cognitive science was written in computers -- I sought to spread the word to every student at my school. “Learn to code and love it!” was what I wanted to shout through the halls. 
		<br><br>I earned my Bachelors of Science in Psychology concentrating in Biological and Evolutionary Sciences from Schreyers Honors College at Penn State University in 2014. During my undergraduate studies I studied neurocognition both academically and in two separate research labs. I was a research assistant for the Behavioral Neuroendocrinology Lab under Dr. Cavigelli where I got to explore how health and environmental exposures can affect neural processes. I was a lab coordinator for a project in Dr. Levy’s lab that involved exploring telomere degeneration in individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder to better understand how stress and sensitive perceptions of others can quite literally affect our DNA. My honors thesis was written on neurocognition and executive function of those with Borderline Personality Disorder. Academically, I dove deep into understanding how a variety of biological and nonbiological factors affect our cognition. 
		<br><br>What kind of teacher would I be if I were a hypocrite? During my sudden realization at the magic of programming, I taught myself. I taught myself so that I could teach (as teaching goes sometimes). I learned HTML so that my students could build websites. I learned CSS so that my students could create web animations. I learned python to help my students create robotics. I learned and learned, and kept learning. But the more I learned, the more I realized I loved doing it more than teaching it. Suddenly, as I was halfway through the year I realized my passion was not in teaching, but was in computer science itself. I needed to refocus my energy on the thing I loved most- the cognitive sciences and it’s new frontier. </p>	
	<h2>The Balanced Life</h2>	
		<p>I firmly believe in the philosophy “work hard, play hard”. Besides, doing the work I love to do, my other two biggest passions are exploring nature and traveling. Between my time in Chicago and Boston, I spent one year traveling to over 20 countries with my fiance. We started in Japan and went down through Asia in Australia and New Zealand and than made our way west, reaching Mount Everest Base Camp and Eastern Europe and finally ending in Morocco. Though we have found our home in Boston, we love to travel for the weekend or on vacation to explore new places. I have been to forty-eight countries and counting! Besides traveling, nothing could replace the feeling of a good hike and camping.  One of the reasons I love New England so much is my ability to do short getaways to plenty of outdoor destinations. The Boston area allows me to live the balanced life.</p>
