	<p>AAs a child, I had two consistent passions. I loved learning about computers and I loved learning about the brain. My parents would always joke that even at the age of 9, I was the one to set up all the technology around the house and knew intuitively how to operate any devices around the house. Simultaneously, I was the child who borrowed my parent’s medical school textbooks to learn more about human anatomy and the brain. Growing up, I assumed these two passions were parallel and not be intersected, so at the start of college I opted for a degree in Psychology focusing in Biological and Evolutionary Sciences and minors in English and Sociology so I could approach the brain and cognitive sciences from all angles: biologically, philosophically, anthropologically, linguistically, and psychologically. I loved college and was so deeply entrenched in my learning that I worked for two different research labs to better understand our wonderful human minds. During my senior year, reading works of Piaget pivoted my interest to consider the human brain over time and I became fascinated with child development both physically and academically. Joining Teach for America (TFA), I had the chance to better understand first hand how humans learn and grow over time. </p>
  <p>During all this, my love for technology never faded. In my research labs, I was notorious for being the master of excel and documentation. In TFA, I was known as the teacher who tracked data meticulously and used cutting edge EdTech in the classroom for student engagement. It was no surprise to anyone when I was asked to teach Computer Science alongside of Math and Science in Boston. Having no prior knowledge in coding, the idea of learning to code and teaching code was exhilarating. I love to learn and I am a huge self-learner, so as soon as I accepted the position, I begin to teach myself how to code. I became so involved with computer science I was soon a leader of the school’s Robotics team and founded Girls Who Code at my school. </p>
  <p>It was in the middle of teaching coding that I realized that my two passions in life-- technology and cognitive sciences-- were not parallels but in fact very much an aligned industry in 2018. It is now with great enthusiasm that I pursue the exact alignment of my life-long passions: I seek to be a Full Stack Developer in Boston for a company at the fringes of innovation intersecting at cognitive science and technology. </p>

    <p>Perhaps one of the most bold decisions I have made in life is to leave behind a successful career of four years and jump into the field of technology.

      <p>Passionate about the social justice mission statement of Brooke, I accepted a role as a Math, Scinece, and Computer Science teacher. As a natural self-learner, I begin to teach myself the basics of computer science. I helped to develop the middle school computer science cirriculum. I co-lead the Robotics team and soon launced Girls Who Code. With the help of the Nationwide Girls Who Code resources, I developed a cirriculum that would teach young minority girls to learn HTML, CSS, Python, and Ruby on Rails.</p>

      <p>While my focus in college was in the cognitive sciences, reading works by Piaget pivoted my cognitive science interest slightly to an interest in child development and the learning of a child both behaviorally and academically over time. Upon graduating, I accepted a position with Teach for America in Chicago not only because I strongly believe in creating equitable educational opportunities, but also better comprehend the learning process of children and how the American education system addresses this process.</p>

    <div class="jobdescrip">
      <p>I earned my Bachelors of Science in Psychology concentrating in Biological and Evolutionary Sciences from Schreyers Honors College at Penn State University in 2014. I also obtained two minors: English and Sociology. I have had a lifelong passion for understanding the cognitive science from all angles, from philosophy, linguistics, psychology, anthropology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. My academic journey led me to take courses in all these topics. I absolutely loved school and strived to absorb as much information as I could. I was incredibly invovled with academics and won several scholarships for the research I was conducting and my academic merits. I was able to present posters and my thesis at national conferences on executive function.</p>

      <p>I worked in Dr. Levy’s laboratory for personality, psychopathology, and psychotherapy research.

In the lab, I was most intrigued by our study exploring telomere degeneration in individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder to better understand how stress and sensitive perceptions of others can quite literally affect our DNA. My honors thesis was  written on neurocognition and executive function of those with Borderline Personality Disorder. </p>
