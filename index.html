                    <p>
                        Currently, I’m a Software Engineer 2 at an innovative biotech startup in Boston. We are motivated to make biology easier
                        to engineer. This means we are building software to efficiently and effectively program cells. If we believe that DNA is
                        the code of life, then we can code DNA to program cells in applications such as health, sustainability, and foods (like
                        the impossible burger!). Check out more of what our software team is doing on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/GinkgoBits">Ginkgo Bits</a>
                    <br><br>
                      I am a full stack developer with a background in STEM education and a deep curiosity for all things math and science. Graduating from the Penn State honors
                      college in 2014, I decided to join Teach for America  in Chicago as I deeply believe in their mission to create equitable educational opportunity for all
                      students across America. For two years I taught math and science in West Chicago and earned a Master degree in education from Dominican University.
                    <br><br>
                      After TFA, I took a position as a Computer Science, Math, and Science teacher at a innovative school in Boston.
                      When I was first asked to be a Computer Science teacher, I was immediately exhilarated about the opportunity to learn more about coding.
                      I started by taking an EdX course on python to learn computer science basics. I was captivated. I quickly became passionate about the logic
                      and problem-solving of coding and fascinated with the incredible possibilities of tech. I soon co-led the Robotics team and founded and led Girls Who Code.
                      I worked on developing a comprehensive computer science curriculum at my school utilizing Scratch, Lego Mindstorms, and Google's CS First curriculum.
                      It was not long before I was coding in all free parts of my day.
                    <br><br>
                      Although I love developing curiosity in others, I quickly realized that my true passion was in coding and creating through the medium of code. I decided to do
                      the General Assembly full immersion career accelerator to learn the latest front-end and back-end tools and technologies and learn more about the computer programming
                      industry. I can happily say taking this leap was one of the best decisions I could have made. I feel as though I have truly found my passion.
                      <br><br>
                    When I first switched careers, I often got the response, “wow! From teacher to software engineer?”. There are actually
                    many skills that translate from being an educator to software engineering. I’m hyper organized and I have the
                    communication and leadership skills that are necessary to thrive beyond technical skills and into creating technology
                    that will allow the business goals to thrive. Being an educator also instilled in my a passion to learn new things and
                    the grit to persist in learning something new. I’m a go-getter who accepts challenges with optimism.

                  <p>
                    I love to stay active! Whether that means walking 10 miles through a huge city like New York, hiking through the wilderness,
                    or biking to work. I love art - from drawing to painting or collecting art from places I've traveled! Most importantly,
                    you'll never find me without a coffee in my hand.

                    I'm a software engineer 2 on the DNA Design Tools team. I started Ginkgo when the concept of a DNA design tool was emerging.
                    Because of this, I got to participate in key design and architectural decisions that have been fundamental in the success of the tool.
                    The DNA design tool is a cloud based computer aided design tool for computational biologist. It allows computational
                    biologist to create combinatorial libraries of DNA to test many different iterations of mutations, genes, and DNA parts such as promoters
                    and terminators to find the best DNA strand to create a target organism. Though the tool is not open source at the
                    moment, feel free to ask me questions on what I’ve worked on!

                              Avana 3D Technologies is a start-up in the Boston area with dreams to bring 3D printers to everyone.
                              As a mobile development consultant, I worked with a designer and product owner to build an e-commerce
                              mobile application for android and iOS. Front-end built with react native. Back-end was built upon
                              Magento's ecommerce platform. At this moment, the app remains proprietary, but feel free to ask me questions about the process!

                                    Keep track of the NE Mountain peaks you've summited! I collected information about each Mountain via web scraping and seeded it into my own Ruby/ Ruby on Rails backend API.
                                    The front-end application is built in React Js. The front-end design is original; I designed my own logo, some of my own icons using Photoshop,
                                    imported a sleek font from google fonts, and used Material-UI components for a friendly user experience. I intergrated a third party API (Dark Sky) to get hourly forecast at the mountain summits. I used Chartjs to graph
                                    temperature at the summit and chance of rain throughout the day.

                                  This single page web application is a tic tac toe game created using Javascript, HTML, CSS/ Sass, and AJAX.
                                  It includes user authentication and all CRUD actions.
                                  The user has a choice to play against another human player or play against a computer.
                                  As my interest has always intersected at technology and cognitive sciences, I decided to create a basic artificial intelligence
                                  using the mathematical decision making algorithm called the minimax algorithm.
                                  As a huge traveler, I couldn't help but create a travel themed game to show the user a variety of world wonders.

                                <p>
                                    Flash vocab is an app where students on the go can study GRE flashcards. The app starts with over 1,000 GRE words to study from.
                                    Add words to your own personal deck that you need to study or practice new words at random.
                                    This is a full-stack single page web application built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS/Sass, Handlebars, and AJAX on the client side. It supports all
                                    user authentication and all CRUD actions.
                                    The back-end was built utilizing test-driven development with Ruby/ Ruby on rails, PostgreSQL, and Heroku.
                                    User stories, wireframes, and entity relationship diagrams are available on github.

                                  As part of General Assembly's program, our team had a mock client in which we had to develop an
                                  MVP of a survey app (similar to SurveyMonkey) in just a three day turnaround time. We had to stick
                                  to an MVP in order to learn and accomplish all CRUD actions in the allotted time.
                                  Built with a variety of tools and technologies including Express.js, Mongodb, Heroku, Bootstrap, and

                                I know first hand how daunting it can be to be at the foothills of the mountain full of knowledge
                                that is computer
                                science and software engineering. Throughout my self-taught experience, I’ve collected a number of
                                resources that have
                                got me to where I am today.
                                My husband is a self taught software engineer who landed a L4 SWE position at Google.
                                He did this by completing 200 leetcode problems (mostly medium) and understanding this list of
                                concepts.
                                These resources helped.
