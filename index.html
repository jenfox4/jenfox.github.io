                <h3 class="sub-heading">About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                      I am a full stack developer with a background in STEM education and a deep curiosity for all things math and science. Graduating from the Penn State honors
                      college in 2014, I decided to join Teach for America  in Chicago as I deeply believe in their mission to create equitable educational opportunity for all
                      students across America. For two years I taught math and science in West Chicago and earned a Master degree in education from Dominican University.
                    <br><br>
                      After TFA, I took a position as a Computer Science, Math, and Science teacher at a innovative school in Boston.
                      When I was first asked to be a Computer Science teacher, I was immediately exhilarated about the opportunity to learn more about coding.
                      I started by taking an EdX course on python to learn computer science basics. I was captivated. I quickly became passionate about the logic
                      and problem-solving of coding and fascinated with the incredible possibilities of tech. I soon co-led the Robotics team and founded and led Girls Who Code.
                      I worked on developing a comprehensive computer science curriculum at my school utilizing Scratch, Lego Mindstorms, and Google's CS First curriculum.
                      It was not long before I was coding in all free parts of my day.
                    <br><br>
                      Although I love developing curiosity in others, I quickly realized that my true passion was in coding and creating through the medium of code. I decided to do
                      the General Assembly full immersion career accelerator to learn the latest front-end and back-end tools and technologies and learn more about the computer programming
                      industry. I can happily say taking this leap was one of the best decisions I could have made. I feel as though I have truly found my passion.
                      <br><br>
                      I am currently applying to full stack developer positions. As a previous educator, I have multiple skills that transfer to the tech industry including
                      leadership, organization, attention to detail, and perseverance through problem solving. I consider myself a go-getter with a lot of grit and I accept challenges with
                      optimism. I am seeking to work on a collaborative and growth mindset team at an innovative company whose mission seeks to better our world.

                  <p>
                    Besides coding in my free time, I have a huge passion for the outdoors and travleling. I have been to 50 countries spanning 6 continents; I love
                    trying new foods and photographing new places. On the weekends, you can find me outdoors. I'm huge outdoors enthusiast and love everything from biking to snowboarding
                    to rock climbing to hiking and camping under the stars.

                              As a mobile development consultant, I worked with a designer and product owner to build an e-commerce
                              mobile application for android and iOS. Front-end built with react native. Back-end was built upon
                              Magento's ecommerce platform. At this moment, the app remains proprietary, but feel free to ask me questions about the process!

                                    Keep track of the NE Mountain peaks you've summited! I web scrapped information about each Mountain and seeded it into my own Ruby/ Ruby on Rails backend API.
                                    The front-end application is built in React Js. The front-end design is original; I designed my own logo, some of my own icons using Photoshop,
                                    imported a sleek font from google fonts, and used Material-UI components for a friendly user experience. I intergrated a third party API (Dark Sky) to get hourly forecast at the mountain summits. I used Chartjs to graph
                                    temperature at the summit and chance of rain throughout the day.

                                  The user has a choice to play against another human player or play against a computer.
                                  As my interest has always intersected at technology and cognitive sciences, I decided to create a basic artificial intelligence
                                  using the mathematical decision making algorithm called the minimax algorithm.
                                  As a huge traveler, I couldn't help but create a travel themed game to show the user a variety of world wonders.

                                <p>
                                  As part of General Assembly's program, our team had a mock client in which we had to develop an
                                  MVP of a survey app (similar to SurveyMonkey) in just a three day turnaround time. We had to stick
                                  to an MVP in order to learn and accomplish all CRUD actions in the allotted time.
                                  Built with a variety of tools and technologies including Express.js, Mongodb, Heroku, Bootstrap, and
                                  AnyChart JavaScript library.
