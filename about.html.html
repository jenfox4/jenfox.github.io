	<p>I have had a life-long passion for understanding the human learning experience; I want to understand how people receive new information, how they process this information, and how people then react to this information. My interest for cognitive science from all angles -- philosophy, linguistics, psychology, anthropology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience-- has driven both my studies and my work experience. With an academic background in psychology and neurocognition research, years of experience teaching numeracy, and a passion for computer programming, the intersection of my passion lies in the new innovations that transform the human learning experience. <br> </p>
	<p>I absolutely love New England and live in the beautiful city of Boston. I enjoy all the outdoor activites the city has to offer. In the afternoons I'll be in my hammock off the water and on the weekends, you can find me in the mountains. I love to be outside! I also have a passion for traveling. I've been to 50 countries and I'm always looking for an excuse to experience another culture! </p>

      <p>While teaching computer science I found myself spending more time coding than thinking about how to teach coding. I quickly realized that my passion in the computer programming, not in teaching. With the love and support from friends and family I took the leap to jump into a field I love.</p>

      <p>Passionate about the social justice mission statement of Brooke, I accepted a role as a Math, Scinece, and Computer Science teacher. As a natural self-learner, I begin to teach myself the basics of computer science. I helped to develop the middle school computer science cirriculum. I co-lead the Robotics team and soon launced Girls Who Code. With the help of the Nationwide Girls Who Code resources, I developed a cirriculum that would teach young minority girls to learn HTML, CSS, Python, and Ruby on Rails.</p>

      <p>While my focus in college was in the cognitive sciences, reading works by Piaget pivoted my cognitive science interest slightly to an interest in child development and the learning of a child both behaviorally and academically over time. Upon graduating, I accepted a position with Teach for America in Chicago not only because I strongly believe in creating equitable educational opportunities, but also better comprehend the learning process of children and how the American education system addresses this process.</p>

      <p>I earned my Bachelors of Science in Psychology concentrating in Biological and Evolutionary Sciences from Schreyers Honors College at Penn State University in 2014. I also obtained two minors: English and Sociology. I have had a lifelong passion for understanding the cognitive science from all angles, from philosophy, linguistics, psychology, anthropology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. My academic journey led me to take courses in all these topics. I absolutely loved school and strived to absorb as much information as I could.</p>

      <p>I worked in Dr. Levyâ€™s laboratory for personality, psychopathology, and psychotherapy research. Though involved in a variety of studies, I was most fascinated in the biological underpinnings of abnormalities. In the lab, I was most intrigued by our study exploring telomere degeneration in individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder to better understand how stress and sensitive perceptions of others can quite literally affect our DNA. My honors thesis was  written on neurocognition and executive function of those with Borderline Personality Disorder. </p>
