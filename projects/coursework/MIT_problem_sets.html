                <h2>The Course</h2>
		<p>I completed the EdX course by MIT titled Introduction to Computer Science and Python. In this course, I learned the fundamentals of computer science and programming in Python. Each week, I was required to complete problem solving task that developed my skills in basic python. Each task is listed along with the final submitted code for each. </p>
 
                <h2>Problem Set 1</h2>
                <h3>Task 1</h3>
                <p>Assume s is a string of lower case characters. Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print: Number of vowels: 5</p>

                <h3>Task 2</h3>
                <p>Assume s is a string of lower case characters.Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print: Number of times bob occurs is: 2</p>

                <h3>Task 3</h3>
                <p>Assume s is a string of lower case characters.Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print: "Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh". In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print: "Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc".</p>

                <h2>Problem Set 2</h2>
                <h3>Task 1</h3>
                <p> Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month. For each month, calculate statements on the monthly payment and remaining balance. At the end of 12 months, print out the remaining balance. Be sure to print out no more than two decimal digits of accuracy. </p>

                <h3>Task 2</h3>
                <p>Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month. Assume that the interest is compounded monthly according to the balance at the end of the month (after the payment for that month is made). The monthly payment must be a multiple of $10 and is the same for all months. Notice that it is possible for the balance to become negative using this payment scheme, which is okay.</p>

                <h3>Task 3</h3>
                <p>Write a program that uses bisection search to find the smallest monthly payment to the cent (no more multiples of $10) such that we can pay off the debt within a year. </p>
