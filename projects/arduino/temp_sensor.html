    <h2 class="h2" id="h2">Concepts Explored:</h2>	
	<p>For my first arduino project, I wanted to become familiar with all the basics of the electrical components. Before starting, I had no idea what an arduino even was. In this project, I learned about resistors, transistors, breadboards, arduinos, the language C, temperature sensors, and the arduino IDE. <br></p>
    <h2 class="h2" id="h2">The task:</h2>	
         <p>Although the goal of this project is to learn, I wanted to make it fun. My fiance always jokes with me that I have about a 5 degree temperature comfort before Iâ€™m too hot or too cold. So, I made a temperature sensor that outputs the temperature in celsius, fahrenheit, and changes the color display based on the temperature. If the temperature is within my 5 degree comfort range, the green LED will light up. If the temperature is just outside my 5 degree comfort range, the yellow LED will light up. If the temperature is way too hot or way too cold, the red LED will light up. </p>
