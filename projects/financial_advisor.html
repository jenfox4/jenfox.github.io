		<h1>Financial Advisor</h1>
		<p>Albeit basic, this task shows my self-learning attitude and ability to figure out task on my own. Having only a few weeks of a python course through Edx, this project was in conjunction with the MIT online course Introduction to Computer Programming. I was tasked with three different problems to calculate debt payments. The reason I am showcasing this particular problem solving tasks is due to it's progression of challenge, which demonstrate my ability to evolve with the task at hand, but also because I found this task particularly interesting and relevant. Although I have no formal education in finance, I love learning about economics and finance and find scripts that coincide with finance problems to be fascinating.</p>
	<h3>Task 1</h3>
		<p>Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment required by the credit card company each month. For each month, calculate statements on the monthly payment and remaining balance. At the end of 12 months, print out the remaining balance. Be sure to print out no more than two decimal digits of accuracy.</p>

	<h3>Task 2</h3>
		  <p>Now write a program that calculates the minimum fixed monthly payment needed in order pay off a credit card balance within 12 months. By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month. Assume that the interest is compounded monthly according to the balance at the end of the month (after the payment for that month is made). The monthly payment must be a multiple of $10 and is the same for all months. Notice that it is possible for the balance to become negative using this payment scheme, which is okay.</p>

	<h3>Task 3</h3>
		<p>Write a program that uses bisection search to find the smallest monthly payment to the cent (no more multiples of $10) such that we can pay off the debt within a year. </p>
