	<h1>Simple Stopwatch Project</h1>
		<p>For my second arduino project, I continued to become familiar with all the basics of the electrical components. In this project, I further learned the basics of breadboards and resistors and explored the coding fundamentals of a 7 segment display.
         <p> I am working on building a stopwatch as part of a bigger project (ever timed how fast you can chug a beer? :) ). Essentially, the aim of this project is to just explore 7 segment displays and counters. I learned how to connect jump cables on the breadboard utilizing resistors across multiple columns and rows, how to program a seven segment display and how to use simple fraction math to created functions that determine what place value is displayed.</p>
