    <h1>Battleship</h1>
	<p>To first learn how to code, I went through CodeAcademy's course to learn basic syntax. This battleship game was made in conjunction with Code Academy's course on python. In order to successfully complete this project, I had to understand the edge cases and break down the problems into smaller pieces of code. For each edge case, I created a new condition with a new output in the game. I also worked on comprehending a variety of different print techniques including the .join â€‹function to create a seamless user interface. This code helped me understand the fundamentals of a variety of python concepts and taught me how to take larger tasks and break them into smaller edge cases. </p>
