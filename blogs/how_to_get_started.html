     <p>It dawned on me when my mother was asking where the heck I learned to make a website while not knowing a single person who has taught me how to code: I had to jog my memory on how exactly I got here and I realized it wasn’t pretty. I knew I wanted to code after teaching Scratch to my middle schoolers and realizing I was more into it than they were. I wanted to be a better computer science teacher so I decided to learn how to code. I had no idea how I was going to learn, but I wanted to. Here’s where it gets messy-- nothing is complied in a nice neat bow on the internet. I had to google forms and discussion boards and reach out to people who I knew that did a little coding here and there to figure out how to even get started. I’m probably too organized for my own good, but looking back and realizing how messy the internet is and how nonlinear learning how to code can be, I’ve decided to dedicate this blog posting to laying out all the resources that I know of that can help a brand new starry eyed learner get started. Side note: I'm under the impression that people using this blog are looking for free resources. There are plenty of paid services, however I want to list the opportunities for people to learn entirely on their own and for free.</p>

      <h2>Free Online College Courses</h2>
      <p>One of my favorite ways to learn coding fundamentals has been to go back to college-- for free! Thanks to the internet you are never far away from some of the best professors in this world. I took several online courses at my own pace to catch myself up on the fundamentals. The best part for me is that there are quizzes, homework assignments, and midterms to track your progress. Without any help, I found this to be the best way to self-measure my progress. Below are a list of websites that offer free online college courses ranging from Yale to Harvard to MIT. Search up any language or topic such as Artifical Intelligence and begin learning!</p>      
    <ul>
       <li><a href="http://www.edx.org">EdX</a></li>
       <li><a href="http://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a></li>
       <li><a href="http://www.openculture.com/freeonlinecourses">Open Culture</a></li>    
    </ul>

      <h2>Interactive Learning Platforms</h2>
      <p>Interactive learning platforms are the fast track to the basic skills. If you don't have time for a course and want to learn the basic syntax now, I suggest going through a tutorial on a learning platform. These take you through the basic skills and have you coding right away.</p>      
    <ul>
       <li><a href="http://www.codeacademy.com">Code Academy</a></li>
       <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3 Schools</a></li>
    </ul>
    </div>   

<div class="content"> 
      <h2>Practice and Open Source Learning</h2>
      <p>It's true, the only way to learn is to practice. They say find a project you love and the learning will happen. I couldn't agree more. This website, for example, has been my huge undertaking to learn CSS and HTML and basic front end skills. The best learning either happens when you are practicing or reading other people's code. Below is a list of resources to find help, find projects, or challenge yourself with tasks.</p>      
    <ul>
      <li><a href="codewars.com">Code Wars: games to challenge your problem solving via code</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub">Arduino Project ideas and tutorials</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://codepen.io/">Code Pen: a front-end developers playground</a></li>
      <li><a href="">Interview Cake: interview practice</a></li>
    </ul>
