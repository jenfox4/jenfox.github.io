   <h1>A Quick Overview of Programming Languages</h1>
   <p> When I first heard of all the programming languages thrown my way, I was overwhelmed and frozen. I didn't know what to learn or what any of it meant. Thankfully, with hours of research, I finally begin to understand. This is a quick summary of the most popular programming languages-- let's explore the strengths of each language, who uses each, and why you may want to learn one over the other.</p>

      <h2>Python</h2>
      <h3>Python: What is it?</h3>
      <p>Python is an advanced object-oriented programming language that is flexible and robust. Okay, so I said this was for beginners and I would NOT speak in jargon. So, let's break that down. Python is object-oriented. Object-orientation came in the 1960’s and was a big deal. Before object-oriented languages, you couldn’t edit, delete, or otherwise change variables. Things were pretty static. Programming relied on sequential order and logic. When a language is object-oriented, it means there are objects, or packages of code, that can interact with each other. If you need to call upon a code written earlier, you can! Meaning as you program you can focus more on how the objects interact with each other and reuse a lot of your code. It was pretty revolutionary and helps to write more complex code. To say that it is flexible and robust is pretty self-explanatory. Python is used for everything and anything and has a multitude of awesome features and libraries. It’s a really helpful language for beginners to know.</p>
      <h3>Python: Who uses it and why should I?</h3>
      <p>I will reiterate: it’s a really helpful language for beginners to know. It’s easy to work with, easy to read and write (see pseudo code), and there are lots and lots of resources and libraries out there for Python. It can be somewhat of a glue language, which is extremely helpful. A glue language is a language that can connect between multiple programs and languages.
Python is used in a variety of contexts, but it tends to be most often used in the scientific community on the back-end side of things. Major organizations like Google and NASA use Python but it can also be helpful for small hobby projects. Basically, Python is great for everything and is especially useful in numeric computing and scientific fields. 
</p>   
      <h3>Python: Quick Summary</h3>
      <p>Python is a flexible robust object-oriented language often used in scientific
      fields as a glue language or for rapid development.</p>

      <h2>Java</h2>
      <h3>Java: What is it?</h3>
      <p>Java is general purpose and object-oriented like Python (hint: most languages these days are object-oriented). It’s ideal for web based development for large enterprises because it’s ability to connect with the back-end (all the server and data stuff) and it’s massive community.
</p>
      <h3>Java: Who uses it and why should I?</h3>
      <p>It’s used in a lot of enterprise-level applications for video games and mobile development. Java is the core-foundation for Android apps. There are so many libraries for Java especially for the mobile development community.
</p>   
      <h3>Java: Quick Summary</h3>
      <p>Java is a general purpose object oriented language often used for mobile, web, and game development.</p>
      
      <h2>Ruby/Ruby on Rails</h2>
      <h3>Ruby/Ruby on Rails: What is it?</h3>
      <p>Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented, and general purpose language (I see a trend…). The “on rails” refers to the language of ruby in a server-side web application framework. This means that it is used to automate the overhead of activities in web development. It helps developers with the implementation of libraries, databases, templates, etc.
</p>
      <h3>Ruby/Ruby on Rails: Who uses it and why should I?</h3>
      <p>Ruby is used in robotics, by NASA to conduct simulations, in 3D modeling, and used to manage and track information. Ruby on rails is used by a variety of big companies to run their web applications including Twitter, Amazon, Airbnb, and Groupon. It’s got logs of open source libraries. It’s good for readability and self-documenting and it’s good for rapid development. Oh the terminology! What is rapid development? Well, back in the day they used to use a method called Waterfall where you designed things sequentially and linearly. First, identify the problem, then design, the implement, blah blah blah. As you can imagine, this approach was slow and inefficient. So along comes this guy James Martin who says, “hey, let’s develop this thing rapidly and then fix all the problems”. Essentially, rapid development puts out a prototype first and then works backwards to improve upon it. So, languages with lots of libraries and resources that are super dynamic and flexible are great for rapid development! Just through some code together that has already been established to get that app running, then tweek it.</p>   
      <h3>Ruby/Ruby on Rails: Quick Summary</h3>
      <p>Ruby/Ruby on rails is an object-oriented language sometimes used for 3D modeling and simulations but, on the rails framework is one of the 
       most expansive open source libraries to build web apps.</p>
      
      <h2>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h2>
      <h3>HTML: What is it?</h3>
      <p>HTML is a standard markup language. Think of a red pen marking up a paper. A markup language is a language that literally marks up your text file so that a computer can read it. You can type out a full sentence, then surround it with brackets and the computer will then read it as the heading of your text. A markup language is human readable and computer executable.</p>
      <h3>HTML: Who uses it and why should I?</h3>
      <p>HTML is what makes the internet. Anyone who makes anything on the internet uses HTML. Why should you use it? Obvious. It makes the internet possible *mic drop*</p>   
      <h3>HTML: Quick Summary</h3>
      <p>HTML is the original web development language. It takes texts, adds some fancy brackets to it, and turns it into the internet.</p>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <h3>JavaScript: What is it?</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is not to be confused with Java. Trust me, I’ve done it. JavaScript is a client-side programming language. Client side means that the actions take place on the user’s computer, rather than on a remote server. Basically, if you put JavaScript into a text file on your computer and open it in chrome on airplane mode, it will still work. It runs locally. JavaScript is placed right into an HTML file and makes a webpage more dynamic and fun.
</p>
      <h3>JavaScript: Who uses it and why should I?</h3>
      <p>Web developers use it. Also used in game development. It’s mostly used to make a website more interactive and awesome. It has a lot of frameworks and a really big library.</p>   
      <h3>JavaScript: Quick Summary</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is what helps make the web pages more dynamic.</p>

      <h2>C Language/C++/C#/Objective-C</h2>
      <h3>C Language: What is it?</h3>
      <p>The C language has been around for a while. It’s a middle-level programming language that is used to develop low-level applications. It is NOT object-oriented (what?!). It is structure oriented. This means there is a top down design approach where things are processed in the order they are typed. It is based on a lot of logic with conditional statements and logical statements. C is pretty basic and used on the hardware end of things rather than user interfaces.</p>
      <h3>So what is C vs. C++ vs. C#?</h3>
      <p>So C is this basic primitive language that does things in a logical order and is pretty low-level. That presents an issue for when computers start advancing and need more complex programs to run. Along comes C++, C#, and Objective-C. C++ is an object-oriented extension of C. It’s possible to code in C which makes C++ a hybrid language. It works across all platforms but focuses on working directly with hardware. C# is also an extension of C that is object-oriented. But, C# focuses on working with windows operating system. It also focuses on web, mobile, and desktop applications rather than hardware. Objective-C was Apple’s own version of fixing C and making it object-oriented. Leave it to Apple to create their own language. Apple uses Objective-C for all their apps.
</p>   
      <h3>C Language/C++/C#: Who uses it?</h3>
      <p>C languages are mostly used for packaged software (such as Microsoft Office. Packaged, like the old boxes these CD’s were sold in. Think of software for the masses) and embedded firmware (software that doesn’t get updated. Like your toaster. It runs off a few lines of code that work for the next 20 years). This is where coding meets mechanics. If you want to code Apple apps you got to know Objective-C. Objective-C is used for anything Apple.</p> 
      <h3>C Language/C++/C#: Quick Summary</h3>
      <p>C is a structure oriented language mainly used for hardware development. C++ was an improvement to C because it is object-oriented. C++ works with any platform and is mainly used for firmware and packaged software. C# targets windows operating system and is mainly used for web, mobile, and desktop applications. Objective-C was apple’s response to C Language. Like C++ and C#, it made C an object-oriented language. It is used by apple today to code all apple apps.</p> 

      <h2>PHP</h2>
      <h3>PHP: What is it?</h3>
      <p>PHP is an open-source scripting language designed for creating web pages that work with databases. Scripting language means that it is executed on the server side (meaning not on your computer and off somewhere on some mystical server) so your computer doesn’t have to compile it (turn it into executable code). It is embedded right into HTML. It is used alongside websites to collect data and information.</p>
      <h3>PHP: Who uses it and why should I?</h3>
      <p>You probably could have guessed Facebook uses it. It’s used by a variety of Web Developers to collect information and data. It’s helpful if you have a reason to conduct analytics.</p>   
      <h3>PHP: Quick Summary</h3>
      <p>PHP is a scripting language that is used within HTML to interact with databases.</p>

      <h2>SQL</h2>
      <h3>SQL: What is it?</h3>
      <p>SQL is a database query language NOT a development language. This means it helps make queries or analytics in databases. It’s used to access and manage content in databases.</p>
      <h3>SQL: Who uses it and why should I?</h3>
      <p>SQL is used by most companies that gather data or use data for data mining.</p>   
      <h3>SQL: Quick Summary</h3>
      <p>SQL is a database query language on the backend that allows companies to manipulate information.</p>
