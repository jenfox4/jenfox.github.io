      <p>I find the internet to be one of the most incredible resources known to man. It has helped me tremendously in journey to understanding the various aspects of computer science. Quite simply, without it I would have never been able to do any of this. However, there is a gap in the online resources out there. I have yet to find one place where all the information I seek can be found in one space, neatly organized and, without jargon so that truly new beginners can learn.
<br>I have felt the wormhole at countless times. I’ll look up one thing and not understand the definition which leads me to another website, which in turn leads me to another. Because of my career in teaching, I’m a believer that everything can be broken down to a level in which anyone could understand—from 5 to 55. I believe anyone who wants to can learn a little bit about computer science. I seek to be the starting point for others that are also curious but may be overwhelmed by the wormhole that can pursue.
Thanks for reading and I hope we can learn a little more together!</p>
